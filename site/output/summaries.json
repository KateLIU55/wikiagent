The smog was caused by a combination of industrial emissions and slow-moving air masses, resulting in extremely high levels of PM 2.5 particulate matter, averaging over 150 micrograms per cubic meter in some areas. This led to reduced visibility and major disruptions in transportation, daily activities, and air quality, with airports, highways, and schools being closed. The smog was particularly severe in Shanghai, where the Air Quality Index crossed 300 on December 2. The pollution was attributed to coal burning, which increased during the winter months as residents burned more coal for warmth."

It served as a secondary capital of Liao Dynasty and was also the city of Xizhou Prefecture, Beijin County, and Weipeng County. In 938, Emperor Taizong of Liao renamed the city \"Youzhou Prefecture\" and in 1012, it was renamed to \"Xizhou Prefecture\". The name Xizhou is derived from the phrase \"Yan divides the world, and Jin travels through it as a crossing point\". Liaoning was not under Han Chinese rule from the Later Tang of Five Dynasties to the Ming Dynasty, except for a brief period between 1123 and 1125 when it was under the jurisdiction of Yan Mountain Prefecture of Northern Song Dynasty. During the Jin Dynasty, Liaoning was renovated and expanded to become Zhongdu."
